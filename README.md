# visualize-audio-over-time
In Unity the GetSpectrumData is turning out to be fun. It splits the audiosource sound into samples by frequency at an instant.  If I take those samples at an instant I can visualize them on a series of quad gameobject heights - which kind of looks like a graphic equalizer.   And I dont stop there. I also look at the graphic equalizer display of the sound samples over time and it kind of show the history of the sound.  I can start to see the sound in a new way... giving me ideas!
